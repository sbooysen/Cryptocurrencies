# Cryptocurrencies

In this Module, we helped Martha to gather and sort data for cryptocurrency. The goal was to find clusters that could be used to analyze the data and transform it into something managable for Martha's managers to consider. Using unsupervised data, we created clusters that helped to divide the data up into parts that could be used for predictions.
